# SN74LV8154-Dual-16-bit-counter-IC-Driver-for-Arduino
Library provides driver and API for dual 16-bit counter IC SN74LV8154

This library can be used to output parallel data directly from the counter IC or to interface with a serial shift register.  In the latter case, the [driver for the SN74HC165 shift register](https://github.com/Qubit1028/SN74HC165-8-bit-Parallel-Load-Shift-Register-Driver-for-Arduino) can be used.
